Ingredients for Cheese Ball Recipe
1.Secret Ingredient! This cheese ball recipe is different as it has a secret ingredient â€“ GRAM FLOUR. Now Gram Flour or Besan (as we call it in India) is flour made from husked & split bengal gram (chana dal). This flour not only helps the cheese ball stick together while frying, it also has added health benefits as it is high in protein and fiber and is naturally gluten-free. In the recipe, you can even use chickpea flour (made from white chickpeas).
2.No all-purpose flour: The recipe does not use all-purpose flour but only gram flour. Besan or Chickpea flour is not traditionally used in a cheese ball recipe, so this recipe was one of a kind when I posted it. Since sharing it, I have had a lot of positive feedback and I am happy to report that tasty, satisfying homemade cheese balls are being made in kitchens everywhere!
3.Potatoes: Use potatoes with a high starch content. Russet and Yukon potatoes are a good option.
4.Cheese: The recipe works very well with either cheddar cheese or processed cheese.
